# Nama - Evaluation Project

## The problem

Print to standard output (STDOUT) numbers from 1 to 100. On multiples of 5, change the number to `Nama`. On multiples of 7, change the number to `Team` and on multiples of 35 change for `Nama Team`.

The output format needs to be EXACTLY like this:

```
1, 2, 3, 4, Nama, 6, Team, 8, 9, Nama, 11, 12, 13, Team, Nama, 16, 17, 18, 19, Nama, Team, 22, 23, 24, Nama, 26, 27, Team, 29, Nama, 31, 32, 33, 34, Nama Team, 36, 37, 38, 39, Nama, 41, Team, 43, 44, Nama, 46, 47, 48, Team, Nama, 51, 52, 53, 54, Nama, Team, 57, 58, 59, Nama, 61, 62, Team, 64, Nama, 66, 67, 68, 69, Nama Team, 71, 72, 73, 74, Nama, 76, Team, 78, 79, Nama, 81, 82, 83, Team, Nama, 86, 87, 88, 89, Nama, Team, 92, 93, 94, Nama, 96, 97, Team, 99, Nama
